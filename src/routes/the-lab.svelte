            The lab is my public testing place, that allows people to test out a bunch of my experiments, and give feedback and ideas to further my work.

            Currently, there isnt very many experiments, but I am working on more. I plan to add a web3 experiment, and some more svelte experiments.
            All of the code for these experiments is open source, and can be found on <a class="text-green-300 underline" href="https://github.com/cataclysm-interactive">My Github</a>
